## Contribution guidelines
  1.  Clone the repo to your local machine
  2.  Create a new branch 
      `git checkout -b feature_branch_name`
  3.  Push the local branch to the remote
      `git push -u origin feature_branch_name`
  4.  Do your work on the branch
  5.  Commit and push your changes, make sure to include a description of what your changes are
      <br>a. `git add .` to add all files that have been modified (`git add <filename>` if you only want to add specific changes)
      <br>b. `git commit -m "Comment about what changes you have made"` 
      <br>c. `git push`
  6.  Create a pull request to merge changes to master 
  
  Don't make changes directly to master!! (changes to the readme are ok)
  Pull requests require at least one other person to approve a merge, but you can force a merge with admin privileges if really necessary.
